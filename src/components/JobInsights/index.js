                         <h1>What is Paaq?</h1>
                         <p>Paaq takes the work out of scheduling so our customers have more time to work on what’s really important. Our software is used by millions of people worldwide—with thousands more signing up every day. To maintain this exciting growth, we’re looking for top talent to join our team and help shape the future of our product.</p>

                         <p>As a Principal Engineer focused on Paaq’s APIs, you have the chance to help lead the design and development of our public API as well as helping define our internal API strategy.  In doing this you will help mentor and grow some of the best and brightest engineers in the world. You will be working with the company's senior leadership, architecture, and product teams to conceive, design, and plan the implementation of major API-first efforts while also rolling up your sleeves and working with engineers on the build and launch phases of an effort.  As a technical leader you bake quality and reliability into your work at every step, focusing not just on the initial delivery but also evolvable design and scalability.</p>
                         <br/>
                         <p>Paaq is built using a service-oriented architecture and an automated continuous delivery system in order to efficiently deliver our product solutions.  To be successful, you will need to help conceive, design, and build well-tested software. You will be using technologies such as Elasticsearch, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails, Node, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, and more. </p>
