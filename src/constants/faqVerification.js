that PAAQ has verified the authenticity of the account representing the public figure, 
celebrity or a verified user on other platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, 
Snapchat or TikTok. Verified badges do not serve as an endorsement.
        
Verified badges are used to help people find the accounts they are looking for easily. 
A verified badge is not a symbol of importance, authority or subject matter expertise.
        
Once you have been verified, you cannot change the username on your account, and 
verification cannot be transferred to another account. Our Community Guidelines 
prohibit PAAQ accounts from impersonating public figures or other people.
        
Please note: Just because you are a public figure, celebrity or a verified user on other 
platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat or TikTok, we
        
not guarantee you will be given a verification badge if what you stand for is against 
our community guidelines.`,
